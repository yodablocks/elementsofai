## Exercise 23: What is the perception of AI?

For this exercise, we want you to think about how AI is portrayed. Do an online **image search** for the term “AI” and see what kinds of pictures come up. If you are using Google search, you should choose "Images" in the top of the screen.

What's the general impression you get about AI from the image search results? Is this an accurate representation of AI? Why or why not?

## Note: 
On using ChatGPT and similar models: We appreciate you putting an AI tool into use. Feel free to consult it but note that since we are interested in your own opinion, we expect you to write your final answers yourself.

## My answer:

When we searched for "AI" on Google Images, we mostly found pictures of circuit brains and shiny robots. They were mostly blue and looked thoughtful. But honestly, these images don't really represent what AI is all about!

AI is actually about solving real-life problems that we face every day. It's not just about playing with wires and circuits to create a robotic brain like in Frankenstein's story. It's much more colorful and exciting than that!

AI is about making our music better, getting more interesting and important news, and even making new friends. It's about using scientific principles to push the boundaries of what our AI systems can do. Most of the time, AI research doesn't involve working with hardware like circuits and wires. It's more like talking to other researchers, writing paper, and programming. 

AI is a lot more fun and practical than what you see in the Google search results. It's all about using technology to make our lives better and solving problems that matter to us.

## Example answer: 

The Google image search with the query "AI" brought us almost exclusively brains made of circuits. After scrolling down a bit, we also got some shining white humanoid robots, often in a very pensive state. The color blue is dominant. Based on this, the impression would be that AI is about tinkering with wires and circuits, trying to build an electronic brain in some modern Frankenstein spirit. Not much color, not much fun.

We don't think that this is an accurate representation of AI at all! AI is about solving practical, human problems, in our everyday life: better music, more interesting and important news, making new friends. Even the research side of AI, which is not what most of the Google hits are about, almost never involves working with hardware such as circuits and wires. It is mostly simply about applying sound scientific principles to understand how we can push the limits of our AI methods. It often takes a lot of talking to other researchers, writing on scrap paper, and programming. Not really much different from any other research.
