# The societal implications of AI

## Exercise 24: Implications of AI 

What kind of articles (in newspapers and magazines or other popular science outlets such as blogs, ...) are being written about AI - and do you think they are realistic? Do an online search about AI related to one of your interests. **Choose one of the articles and analyze it**.

1. Mention the **title of the article** along with its author and where it was published (as a URL if applicable) in your answer.
2. Explain the central idea in the article **in your own words** using about a paragraph of text (multiple sentences.)
3. Based on your understanding, how accurate are the AI-related statements in the article? **Explain your answer**. Are the implications (if any) realistic? **Explain why or why not**.

Title: Wimbledon to Feature AI Commentary and Draw Analysis

Author: AI News

Publication: https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/2023/06/22/wimbledon-feature-ai-commentary-draw-analysis/

The article discusses how Wimbledon will be using AI to enhance the fan experience in 2023. The tournament will feature two new AI-powered features: AI commentary and draw analysis. The AI commentary will provide real-time insights and analysis of the matches, while the draw analysis will provide a statistical breakdown of the tournament draw.

The implications of the article are that AI is becoming increasingly integrated into sports. AI is being used to provide insights into matches, to analyze tournament draws, and to even provide commentary. This trend is likely to continue in the future, as AI becomes more sophisticated and as it becomes more affordable.

The implications of the article are realistic. AI is already being used in a variety of sports, and it is only a matter of time before it becomes even more widespread. The two new AI-powered features that will be featured at Wimbledon in 2023 are just a taste of what is to come.

## Example answer:

Many of the articles that we studied were about the great promise of AI in different areas such as health-care, finance, customer service, transportation... you name it. A pattern that seems to repeat is that Google, IBM, Microsoft, or some of the other big players in the field have demonstrated a prototype product and the reporter is amazed by it. This tends to be combined with an estimate of the US or global market of the industry in question, which easily amounts to billions of euros.

The articles very rarely report anything about the actual techniques underlying the solutions, which is quite understandable since many readers wouldn't be able to digest any technical details. (You would!)

A few of the articles we reviewed contain statements about AI "reading millions of pages" and "comprehending them", but to be honest, we were actually expecting worse based on our Facebook feed. Perhaps the social media recommendations we get (based on our clicks! makes you wonder...) are of lower quality than what Google search can provide?
