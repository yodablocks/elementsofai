# Summary

## Exercise 25: AI in your life

How do you see AI affecting you in the future, both at work and in everyday life? Include both the positive and possible negative implications.

## Note: 
On using ChatGPT and similar models: We appreciate you putting an AI tool into use. Feel free to consult it but note that since we are interested in your own opinion, we expect you to write your final answers yourself.

## My answer:

Let's start with the positive stuff! AI has the potential to make our lives easier and more convenient. It can help us with tasks like personal assistants that schedule our appointments, smart homes that adjust settings automatically, and even self-driving cars that make our commutes safer and less stressful. 

When it comes to work, AI can be super helpful too. It can automate repetitive tasks, allowing us to focus on more creative and interesting work. It can also assist in data analysis, making it faster and more accurate. Plus, AI can help us in fields like medicine by improving diagnosis and treatment options.

But of course, there are some possible negatives too. AI might replace some jobs, leading to unemployment. It's important to find ways to adapt and learn new skills to stay relevant in the changing job market. Another issue is privacy since AI relies on collecting and analyzing data, so we need to make sure our personal information is protected.

AI can be really awesome and helpful in many ways, but we need to be careful too. It's important to think about the challenges that come with it and make sure we use AI in a responsible and fair way. 

## Example answer:

We genuinely look forward to what tomorrow has in store for us. At work, new assisting technologies emerge and existing ones mature to the point of being less annoying than useful. We'll be able to complete our work more efficiently when interacting with machines takes less effort, and we can spend more time interacting with our colleagues and our loved ones.

In our everday life, we are curious to see AI applications in entertainment such as movies and games. The ways in which we (everyone) use social media and access information online need to change, with more respect for privacy and truthfulness. An end needs to be put to the post-truth era, which is in part a consequence of filter bubbles created by AI algorithms. In this respect, we hope that the balance will tip more towards the good uses of AI and away from the bad ones. Personally, we will do our very best to contribute to this process.

Above all, we will be excited to hear back from you and learn about what we can achieve together by investing time and effort in open AI education, learning about AI, and using our improved understanding to do wonderful things.

# This is not the end. This is the beginning.

That’s it for now. We thank you for joining us. This has been a great adventure for us, and we really hope that you enjoyed it too. We are not yet finished with the course, and I believe we will never be. We will keep doing our best updating and improving it, and making it the best AI MOOC in the world.

Like the course isn’t finished, you shouldn’t think that your exploration of AI is finished either. The progress is quite rapid and it may seem too much to keep track of, but the comforting news is that the basic principles have stayed more or less the same decade after decade. As long as you know the basics about problem-solving strategies, handling uncertainty, and learning from data, you should be able to easily put new things into perspective. This is why you had to draw diagrams with chickens crossing rivers, Towers of Hanoi, why you had to calculate the probability of rain in Helsinki, or detect happy faces by a neural network. Knowing the fundamentals, or the elements of AI, is much longer lasting knowledge than learning the technical details of a particular AI solution.

Below we give a few pointers that we have found useful. Keep learning, stay curious.
