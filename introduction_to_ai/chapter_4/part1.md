# The types of machine learning

## Three types of machine learning

### Supervised learning
### Unsupervised learning
### Reinforcement learning

The categories are somewhat overlapping and fuzzy, so a particular method can sometimes be hard to place in one category. For example, as the name suggests, so-called semisupervised learning is partly supervised and partly unsupervised.
