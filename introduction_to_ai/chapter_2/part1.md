## Exercise 5: A smaller rowboat

In the traditional version of this puzzle the robot can only fit one thing on the boat with it. The state space is still the same, but fewer transitions are possible.

**Using the diagram with the possible states below as a starting point, draw the possible transitions in it** (it is MUCH easier to do this with a pencil and paper than without).

Having drawn the state transition diagram, **find the shortest path from NNNN to FFFF, and calculate the number of transitions on it.**

Please type your answer as the **number of transitions in the shortest path** (just a single number like "12"). Do NOT include any further description of your solution. Hint: Do not count the number of states, but the number of transitions. For example, the number of transitions in the path NNNN → FFNF → NFNF → FFFF is 3 instead of 4.
