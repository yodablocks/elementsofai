# Philosophy of AI

# Exercise 4: Definitions, definitions

## Which definition of AI do you like best? How would you define AI?

Let's first scrutinize the following definitions that have been proposed earlier:

- "cool things that computers can't do"
- machines imitating intelligent human behavior
- autonomous and adaptive systems
  
## Your task:

- Do you think these are good definitions? Consider each of them in turn and try to come up with things that they get wrong - either things that you think should be counted as AI but aren't according to the definition, or vice versa. **Explain your answers by a few sentences per item** (so just saying that all the definitions look good or bad isn't enough).

- Also come up with **your own, improved definition** that solves some of the problems that you have identified with the above candidates. Explain with a few sentences how your definition may be better than the above ones.

**Please read the above instructions carefully and answer both of the items above in the text box below. Your answer will be reviewed by other users and by the instructors. Please answer in English, and check your answer before clicking 'Submit' because once submitted, you can no longer edit your answer.**

## Note: 

> On using ChatGPT and similar models: We appreciate you putting an AI tool into use. Feel free to consult it but note that since we are interested in your own opinion, we expect you to write your final answers yourself.

**Your answer should be at least 20 words**
