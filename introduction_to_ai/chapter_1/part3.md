# Philosophy of AI

# Exercise 4: Definitions, definitions

## Which definition of AI do you like best? How would you define AI?

Let's first scrutinize the following definitions that have been proposed earlier:

- "cool things that computers can't do"
- machines imitating intelligent human behavior
- autonomous and adaptive systems
  
## Your task:

- Do you think these are good definitions? Consider each of them in turn and try to come up with things that they get wrong - either things that you think should be counted as AI but aren't according to the definition, or vice versa. **Explain your answers by a few sentences per item** (so just saying that all the definitions look good or bad isn't enough).

- Also come up with **your own, improved definition** that solves some of the problems that you have identified with the above candidates. Explain with a few sentences how your definition may be better than the above ones.

**Please read the above instructions carefully and answer both of the items above in the text box below. Your answer will be reviewed by other users and by the instructors. Please answer in English, and check your answer before clicking 'Submit' because once submitted, you can no longer edit your answer.**

## Note: 

> On using ChatGPT and similar models: We appreciate you putting an AI tool into use. Feel free to consult it but note that since we are interested in your own opinion, we expect you to write your final answers yourself.

**Your answer should be at least 20 words**

## My answer

"AI as cool things that computers can't do":
This means AI is about creating computer programs that can do things that regular programs can't. It includes a wide range of exciting AI applications like computer vision and natural language processing. The downside is that it doesn't cover problems that have already been solved in AI, and it's hard to say what exactly is considered "cool."

"AI as machines imitating intelligent human behavior":
This definition says that AI is about making machines act intelligently, even if they're not truly intelligent. They learn to do tasks that humans can do, like solving problems or making decisions. It's good because it includes similar ideas to the previous definition and uses the word "imitate" instead of being truly intelligent. But the downside is that it raises questions about what exactly is "intelligent," and it focuses mainly on human-like behavior, leaving out other forms of intelligence like swarm intelligence.

"AI as autonomous and adaptive systems":
This definition highlights two main things about AI. First, it's about making machines work on their own, without constant human control. For example, robots or self-driving cars that can operate independently. Second, it's about making machines that can learn and improve based on data, like how they get better at a task with practice. This fits well with machine learning, a type of AI that learns from examples. However, it can be confusing because the idea of "autonomous" isn't very clear (like whether a robot vacuum cleaner counts). Also, not all AI systems need to be fully autonomous, and combining human and machine intelligence can often achieve even better results.

## Example Answer: 

There is no right or wrong answer, but here’s what we think:

“Cool things that computers can't do"

The good: this adapts to include new problems in the future, captures a wide range of AI such computer vision, natural language processing.

The bad: it rules out any "solved" problems, very hard to say what counts as "cool".

“Machines imitating intelligent human behavior”

The good: the same as in the previous. Also, imitate is a good word since it doesn't require that the AI solutions should "be" intelligent (whatever it means) and it's instead enough to act intelligently.

The bad: the definition is almost self-referential in that it immediately leads to the question what is 'intelligent', also this one is too narrow in the sense that it only includes human-like intelligent behavior and excludes other forms of intelligence such as so-called swarm intelligence (intelligence exhibited by for example ant colonies).

“Autonomous and adaptive systems”

The good: it highlights two main characteristics of AI, captures things like robots, self-driving cars, and so on, also nicely fits machine learning-based AI methods that adapt to the training data.

The bad: once again, these lead to further questions and the definition of 'autonomous' in particular isn't very clear (is a vacuum cleaner bot autonomous? How about a spam filter?). Furthermore, not all AI systems need to be autonomous and we can in fact often achieve much more by combining human and machine intelligence.

# After completing Chapter 1 you should be able to:

+ Explain autonomy and adaptivity as key concepts for explaining AI

+ Distinguish between realistic and unrealistic AI (science fiction vs. real life)

+ Express the basic philosophical problems related to AI including the implications of the Turing test and Chinese room thought experiment
