# Conclusion 

# I. Summary

## So what now?

As we have made sure to remind ourselves, even the latest AI technology – with deep learning and all – has limits. Some people, such as the well-known New York University psychology professor, author and entrepreneur Gary Marcus are saying we're going to enter another AI winter soon because of these limits. Who can tell?

Jeremy Howard, perhaps best known as the co-founder of [fast.ai](https://fast.ai), a deep learning platform and for his hugely popular (for good reason!) free online courses, says no one can reliably predict how fast and along which paths the science of AI will progress in the coming years. However, Howard also points out that it isn't really necessary to know what the next big thing in AI will be because even with the existing tools, we can solve huge problems of great societal importance.

To conclude, it's now up to **YOU** to use existing **AI technology** to make the world a *better place*.

**Congratulations for finishing the course!**

**I wanted to add, I primarily utilize Google Colab for testing my code due to its reliability and efficiency.**

# II. Your AI idea

So far, you have worked within the safe harbor of this course. The goal was to let you focus on the content instead of learning to install and use new applications and systems. The content was structured as small nuggets that you could solve one at a time to eventually construct the bigger picture – not unlike a jigsaw puzzle.

But real-world problems aren't always served in single-serve portions. It's also necessary to practice the art of identifying a specific problem and sketching a solution without having a ready-made problem statement to begin with. Building AI solutions for real-world problems also requires that we venture out of our safe harbor and engage with the world. This can mean actively seeking more information about a problem, talking to those affected by it, teaming up with the rest of the AI community, and learning to use new tools.

You can browse example projects created by others to gain inspiration, but don't hesitate to be creative and to think outside the box. The best-case scenario is that, with time, your project will grow into something that creates real change in your own community.

## It's time for your AI idea

To make it easier for you, we’re proposing you structure the project description around a list of topics. Once you have written down a few thoughts about each of these topics, you already have enough material to submit your project! If you’re up to it, you can also expand this into a working demo or prototype with code and data.

### The topics we’ll ask you to elaborate are:

1. **Your idea in a nutshell:** Name your project and prepare to describe it briefly.

2. **Background:** What is the problem your idea will solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

3. **Data and AI techniques:** What data sources does your project depend on? Almost all AI solutions depend on some data. The availability and quality of the data are essential. Which AI techniques do you think will be helpful? Depending on whether you've been doing the programming exercises or not, you may choose to include a concrete demo implemented by coding, using some actual data!

4. **How is it used:** What is the context in which your solution is used, and by whom? Who are the people affected by it? It’s important to appreciate the viewpoints of all those affected.

5. **Challenges:** What does your project not solve? It’s important to understand that any technological solution will have its limitations.
What next: How could your project grow and become something even more?

6. **Acknowledgments:** If you’re using open source code or documents in your project, make sure you give credit to the creators. Mention your sources of inspiration, too.

## To make things simple, we’ve created a template you can use to draft your README:

```
<!-- This is the markdown template for the final project of the Building AI course, 
created by Reaktor Innovations and University of Helsinki. 
Copy the template, paste it to your GitHub README and edit! -->

# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Describe briefly in 2-3 sentences what your project is about. About 250 characters is a nice length! 


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1
* problem 2
* etc.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
