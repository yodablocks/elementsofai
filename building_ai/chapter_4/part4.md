# Conclusion 

# I. Summary

## So what now?

As we have made sure to remind ourselves, even the latest AI technology – with deep learning and all – has limits. Some people, such as the well-known New York University psychology professor, author and entrepreneur Gary Marcus are saying we're going to enter another AI winter soon because of these limits. Who can tell?

Jeremy Howard, perhaps best known as the co-founder of [fast.ai](https://fast.ai), a deep learning platform and for his hugely popular (for good reason!) free online courses, says no one can reliably predict how fast and along which paths the science of AI will progress in the coming years. However, Howard also points out that it isn't really necessary to know what the next big thing in AI will be because even with the existing tools, we can solve huge problems of great societal importance.

To conclude, it's now up to **YOU** to use existing **AI technology** to make the world a *better place*.
